I live in San Francisco, California. I love learning new things about math,
computing and physics. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling and spending time with
my fiancee Kathleen and my two excellent cats, Henry and Momo. My favorite
theorem is the [Reisz representation theorem][1], and I worship at the
[Church of Emacs][2].
