# About Me

I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.

I've worked with [Stage 1 start-ups][5] and [publicly traded corporations][6], building
models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Python, but I also speak R and Matlab. I have
experience working with scikit-learn, Tensorflow, pandas, and many other popular
data analysis and machine learning libraries. 

I have a bachelors degree in Physics from Reed College, where I did
[my thesis][2] on measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. I'm currently finishing
up my dissertation, which covers a range of topics in statistics, data
analytics, and understanding noisy systems. For more details on all that, check
out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or take a look at [my resume][4].

I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges. If you've got a data
problem you want to address, or just want to know what you can get out of all
this information you're gathering, [drop me a line][1].

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.
