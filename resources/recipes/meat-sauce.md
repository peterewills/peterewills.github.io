# Hearty Meat Sauce with Vegetables

## Protein & Base

* 3 lbs ground beef
* 2 tsp olive oil

## Vegetables

* 6 medium sweet onions, diced
* 3 red bell peppers, diced
* 24 oz mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup garlic, minced

## Sauce

* 2 (28 oz) cans crushed tomatoes
* 1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
* 2 bay leaves

## Spices

* 2½ tsp dried basil
* 1½ tsp dried oregano
* ¾ tsp dried thyme
* 1½ tsp salt (plus more to taste)
* ¾ tsp black pepper (plus more to taste)
* ¾ tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Season with half the salt and pepper. Cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan.

2. Reduce heat to medium. Add the diced onions and bell peppers to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and starting to caramelize, about 10-12 minutes. The natural sweetness of those sweet onions will really develop here.

3. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 5-7 minutes until they've released their moisture and started to brown.

4. Add half the minced garlic along with the tomato paste. Stir constantly for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the paste and mellow the garlic.

5. Add the basil, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir for about 1 minute until fragrant.

6. Return the browned beef to the pan. Add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and remaining garlic. Stir everything together well.

7. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers (up to 2 hours), the better the flavors will meld. Add a splash of water if it gets too thick.

8. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. Remove the bay leaves before serving.

**Notes:**
- This recipe is Whole30 compliant
- This makes a large batch—great for freezing portions for later
- If you prefer a thicker sauce, simmer longer uncovered; for thinner, add a bit of beef broth
- Consider slow-cooking the sauce—prepare in the morning, leave in the oven at 275 all day until dinner
- For extra depth, add 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar or a pinch of cinnamon to round out the tomato acidity
