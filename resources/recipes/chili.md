* 4 sweet onions, diced small
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* Salt and black pepper to taste

## Aromatics & Vegetables
* 10 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 bell peppers, diced small
* 4 seeded jalapeño peppers (keep seeds in for spice), diced small

## Tomatoes
* 6 Tbsp tomato paste
* 2 (28-oz) cans fire roasted crushed tomatoes

## Liquids & Flavor Enhancers
* 3 cups beef broth
* 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 3-4 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* ½ tsp liquid smoke (adjust to taste)

## Beans
* 1 (18-oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 (18-oz) cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 (18-oz) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed

## Spices
* 4 Tbsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp oregano
* 2 tsp salt (plus extra to taste)
* ¾ tsp cayenne pepper
* ¼-½ tsp cinnamon
* ¼ tsp ground cloves (optional)
* 1 tsp instant coffee (mixed with dry spices)
* Black pepper to taste

## Optional Sweetness Adjustment
* 1-2 tsp maple syrup (optional, add at end if needed)

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the ground beef in batches, breaking it up as it cooks. Remove and set aside.

2. In the same pot, sauté the onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute.

3. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes to caramelize slightly.

4. Add all the dry spices (chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, salt, cayenne, cinnamon, and instant coffee). Stir and toast for about 1 minute to bloom the spices.

5. Return the browned beef to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and liquid smoke. Stir well to combine.

6. Bring to a simmer, then transfer to a 275°F oven covered. Cook for 6-8 hours, stirring occasionally.

7. About 1-2 hours before serving, add the drained kidney beans and pinto beans. Stir to combine.

8. Continue cooking until the chili reaches your desired consistency. If it's still too liquidy, you can leave the lid off for the final hour to allow it to reduce.

9. Taste and adjust seasonings. Add brown sugar 1 tsp at a time if you'd like more sweetness, stirring well between additions.

10. Serve hot. The chili tastes even better the next day as flavors continue to develop.

**Serves:** 12-14 people (or great for freezing in portions)

**Notes:**
- The liquid smoke is potent; start with ½ tsp and adjust up if desired
- The cinnamon adds warmth without being obvious—don't skip it
- This recipe develops great depth from the combination of smoked paprika, instant coffee, and liquid smoke
- Maple syrup adds complexity to the sweetness; start with 1 tsp and adjust to taste
