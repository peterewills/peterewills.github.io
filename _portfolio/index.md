# Portfolio

Here you'll find summaries of the major projects I've done over the years, which
are representative of my skills and interests. These projects span everything
from mathematical physics to machine learning, from finance to advertising, from
the theoretical to the practical.

The discussion here is generally non-technical; for the research projects,
related publications can be found in [my resume][1]. There are also links to
documents at the top of each page, which offer more depth. If you're curious
about technical details I've glossed over, feel free to [contact me][2].
