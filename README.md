# Artemis Terminal Chat

A simple terminal-style React chatbot interface for the Artemis API.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the production build in the `docs` folder, which GitHub Pages will serve automatically.
