# Mama Bread

Soft and warm on the inside, crusty and golden on the outside: Experience the joy of this oven-fresh bread slathered with your favourite spread.

## Ingredients

* 1 Tbsp honey (or brown sugar) - about 25g
* 2 tsp instant yeast (10g)
* 2 cups water (500ml)
* 5 cups flour (600-700g)
* 2 tsp salt (10ml)

## Instructions

1. Combine the water, honey and yeast in a mixing bowl. Add the flour and salt then mix with a spatula until a sticky dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap then allow to rise overnight in the fridge.

2. Remove the dough from the fridge and preheat the oven to 180°C/356°F/Gas Mark 4. Tip the dough onto a floured surface and pull the sides into the centre of the dough, forming a round shape.

3. Transfer to a sheet of parchment/baking paper, then cover with a bowl or damp tea towel and allow to rise for 30 minutes. Transfer to a 24cm Dutch oven or round casserole dish.

4. Bake the loaf for 30-40 minutes with the lid on, then remove the lid and bake for another 20 minutes until golden brown. You'll know the bread is ready when it sounds hollow when tapped.

5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
