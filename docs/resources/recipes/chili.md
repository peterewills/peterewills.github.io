* 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 Tbsp maple syrup
* 3-4 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* ½ tsp liquid smoke (adjust to taste)

## Beans
* 1 (18-oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 (18-oz) cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 (18-oz) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed

## Spices
* 4 Tbsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp oregano
* 2 Tbsp salt, plus more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the ground beef in batches, breaking it up as it cooks. Remove and set aside.

2. In the same pot, sauté the onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute.

3. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes to caramelize slightly.

4. Add all the dry spices (chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, salt, cayenne, cinnamon, and instant coffee). Stir and toast for about 1 minute to bloom the spices.

5. Return the browned beef to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and liquid smoke. Stir well to combine.

6. Bring to a simmer, then transfer to a 275°F oven covered. Cook for 6-8 hours, stirring occasionally.

7. About 1-2 hours before serving, add the drained kidney beans and pinto beans. Stir to combine.

8. Continue cooking until the chili reaches your desired consistency. If it's still too liquidy, you can leave the lid off for the final hour to allow it to reduce.

9. Taste and adjust seasonings. Add chipotle for kick; liquid smoke for smoke; maple syrup for sweetness.

10. Serve hot. The chili tastes even better the next day as flavors continue to develop.

**Serves:** 12-14 people (or great for freezing in portions)

**Thoughts for next time:**
- Consider doubling the cinnamon and adding hearty maple syrup for good sweetness to balance the smokiness.

**Notes:**
- The liquid smoke is potent; start with ½ tsp and adjust up if desired
- The cinnamon and optional cocoa powder add warmth and depth without being obvious—don't skip them.
- This recipe develops great depth from the combination of smoked paprika, instant coffee, and liquid smoke
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup provides the perfect balance of sweetness without overpowering the smoky elements
- Start with 2 Tbsp salt and taste as you cook—you may want to add more depending on your broth and Worcestershire sauce saltiness
- Cocoa powder (unsweetened) enhances the savory richness without adding sweetness; start with ½ tsp
