## Medium-boiled Eggs

Heat water to a boil. Put eggs in for 9 minutes. Remove and immediately put in an ice
bath until chilled, ~15 minutes. Dry and place in refridgerator.

## Beef Jerky

Start with a roast, typically a 2 lb top round roast. Make the marinade by combining 1
cup soy sauce and 1/4 Worchestershire sauce. Slice the roast as thinly as you can
manage, and marinate for 4 to 24 hours.

Arrange the slices in a air-frying basket so there is no (or minimal) overlap. Season
with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Run the toaster oven in dehydrate mode at 165
degrees for 4 hours (more if the slices are thick, or you want it more chewy).

## Sausage Patties

Mix the following in a spice mill to get them powdered and smooth:

- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black peper
- 1 tsp dried sage
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp crushed fennel

Mix the spice blend into 1 lb of ground pork. Form into six patties (for ~200 kcal
per).

## Hollyhock Dressing

Mix the following in the blender:

- ½ Cup Nutritional Yeast Flakes
- ⅓ Cup Water
- ⅓ Cup Apple Cider Vinegar or Balsamic Vinegar
- ⅓ Cup Soy Sauce
- 1 ½ Cups Sunflower Oil

Blend on high to ensure good emulsification.

## Em's Bread

* 1 Tbsp honey (or brown sugar) - about 25g
* 2 tsp instant yeast (10g)
* 2 cups water (500ml)
* 5 cups flour (600-700g)
* 2 tsp salt (10ml)

1. Combine the water, honey and yeast in a mixing bowl. Add the flour and salt then mix
   with a spatula until a sticky dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap then allow to rise
   overnight in the fridge.

2. Remove the dough from the fridge and preheat the oven to 180°C/356°F/Gas Mark 4. Tip
   the dough onto a floured surface and pull the sides into the centre of the dough,
   forming a round shape.

3. Transfer to a sheet of parchment/baking paper, then cover with a bowl or damp tea
   towel and allow to rise for 30 minutes. Transfer to a 24cm Dutch oven or round
   casserole dish.

4. Bake the loaf for 30-40 minutes with the lid on, then remove the lid and bake for
   another 20 minutes until golden brown. You'll know the bread is ready when it sounds
   hollow when tapped.

5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
