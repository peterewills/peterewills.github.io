## Protein

* 2.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast, cooked and shredded

## Aromatics & Vegetables

* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion, chopped
* 1 large jalapeño pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped
* 2 bell peppers, diced
* 2 medium zucchini, diced
* 2 Tbsp minced garlic (about 5 cloves)

## Spices

* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 Tbsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper, to taste
* 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
* Freshly cracked black pepper

## Liquids & Beans

* 4 cups chicken broth
* 2 (15-oz) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 (4-oz) cans diced green chiles

## Finishing

* 1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
* Juice of one lime (plus lime wedges for serving)
* Fresh cilantro (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, jalapeño, bell peppers, and zucchini and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.

2. Add the chicken broth, cannellini beans and diced green chiles with their liquid; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth has reduced by about half, 18 to 20 minutes. Off the heat, use a wooden spoon to mash some of the beans against the side of the pot. Continue mashing the beans until the broth is noticeably thicker.

3. Return the pot to medium, stir in the chicken and corn, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Juice the lime over the pot, then taste for seasonings and add more salt, black pepper, and cayenne, if desired.

4. Serve the chili in bowls with a lime wedge and fresh cilantro if desired.
