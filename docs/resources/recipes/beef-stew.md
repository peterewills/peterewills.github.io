# High-Protein, Low-Calorie Beef Stew

Modified from NYT Cooking - Slow Oven Method

## Protein & Base

* 3.5 lbs beef stewing meat (sirloin or round), trimmed and cut into inch cubes
* ¼ tsp freshly ground pepper
* 2 tsp vegetable oil

## Liquids & Aromatics

* 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
* 1 cup red wine
* 4 cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned (plus more if needed)
* 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp dried thyme (or 4-5 sprigs fresh thyme)
* 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 1-2 sprigs fresh rosemary)
* 4-6 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tsp salt

## Vegetables

* 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
* 5 medium carrots, peeled and cut into ¼-inch rounds
* 3 celery stalks, chopped
* 8 oz mushrooms, quartered
* 3 cups cauliflower florets (divided: 1.5 cups for beginning, 1.5 cups for end)
* 2 cups green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces

## Finishing

* Fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 275°F.

2. Brown the beef: Season beef with pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown beef in batches (don't overcrowd), about 5 minutes per batch. Remove beef and set aside.

3. Deglaze: Add vinegar and wine to the pot. Cook over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes.

4. Build the base: Return beef to pot. Add beef broth, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. Stir to combine.

5. Add vegetables for long cooking: Add onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, garlic, and 1.5 cups of the cauliflower. Season with salt and pepper. Stir everything together.

6. Cover and bake: Put the lid on and transfer to the oven. Cook for 6-8 hours at 275°F.

7. Check liquid level: After 1-2 hours, check the stew. The vegetables should have released liquid and the level should have risen. If it looks dry, add ½-1 cup more broth.

8. Add final vegetables: In the last 30-45 minutes of cooking, add the remaining 1.5 cups cauliflower and the green beans. Stir gently, return to oven.

9. Finish: Remove from oven. The stew should be thick and rich. If too thin, simmer uncovered on the stovetop for 10-15 minutes. If too thick, add a splash of broth or water.

10. Final touches: Remove bay leaves and any woody herb stems. Taste and adjust salt and pepper. Stir in fresh chopped parsley. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.

**Serves:** 4

**Notes:**
- The early cauliflower will break down and thicken the stew naturally
- The late cauliflower will stay in chunks for texture
- Check once at the halfway point if you're home, but it should be fine without intervention
