* 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp dried thyme (or 4-5 sprigs fresh thyme)
* 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 1-2 sprigs fresh rosemary)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 275°F.

2. Brown the beef: Season beef with pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown beef in batches (don't overcrowd), about 5 minutes per batch. Remove beef and set aside.

3. Deglaze: Add vinegar and wine to the pot. Cook over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes.

4. Build the base: Return beef to pot. Add beef broth, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. Stir to combine.

5. Add vegetables: Add onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, potatoes, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Stir everything together.

6. Cover and bake: Put the lid on and transfer to the oven. Cook for 6-8 hours at 275°F.

7. Check liquid level: After 1-2 hours, check the stew. The vegetables should have released liquid and the level should have risen. If it looks dry, add ½-1 cup more broth.

8. Finish: Remove from oven. The stew should be thick and rich. If too thin, simmer uncovered on the stovetop for 10-15 minutes. If too thick, add a splash of broth or water.

9. Final touches: Remove bay leaves and any woody herb stems. Taste and adjust salt and pepper. Stir in fresh chopped parsley. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
