# Hearty Meat Sauce with Vegetables

This rich, chunky meat sauce is perfect over pasta, in lasagna, or anywhere you need a robust tomato-based sauce.

## Protein & Base

* 2 lbs ground beef
* 2 tsp olive oil

## Vegetables

* 4 large sweet onions, diced
* 2 bell peppers, diced
* 1 lb mushrooms, sliced
* 6 cloves garlic, minced

## Sauce

* 1 (45 oz) jar Ragu Traditional Chunky sauce
* 1 bay leaf

## Spices

* 1½ tsp dried basil
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* ½ tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp salt (plus more to taste)
* ½ tsp black pepper (plus more to taste)
* ½ tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Season with half the salt and pepper. Cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan.

2. Reduce heat to medium. Add the diced onions and bell peppers to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and starting to caramelize, about 10-12 minutes. The natural sweetness of those sweet onions will really develop here.

3. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 5-7 minutes until they've released their moisture and started to brown.

4. Add the minced garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir constantly for about 1 minute until fragrant.

5. Return the browned beef to the pan. Add the jar of Ragu sauce and the bay leaf. Stir everything together well.

6. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers (up to 2 hours), the better the flavors will meld. Add a splash of water if it gets too thick.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. Remove the bay leaf before serving.

**Notes:**
- This makes a large batch—great for freezing portions for later
- If you prefer a thicker sauce, simmer longer uncovered; for thinner, add a bit of pasta water or beef broth
- For extra depth, you can add a tablespoon of tomato paste when you add the garlic
